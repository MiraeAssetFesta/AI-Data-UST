## Development
### 😺 Commit Convention
We follow a structured commit convention to maintain clarity and consistency in our project history. Each commit message starts with a keyword that describes the nature of the change:
- `feat`: Introducing a new feature
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting and styling changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without functional changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Miscellaneous tasks like updating build scripts or dependencies

Example
```
feat: news data crawling    - {keyword}: {title}
blarvlarblarvlar            - {content}
#1                          - {refered issue}
```


### 😺 Creating and Managing Issues
Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs in the project. They provide a way to organize work, discuss solutions, and keep track of progress. By using issues, team members can easily collaborate and prioritize tasks efficiently.

### 😺 Creating and Managing Pull Requests (PRs)
Pull Requests (PRs) are used to propose changes to the project. When a team member completes a task or fixes a bug, they create a PR to merge their changes into the main codebase. The PR is reviewed by other team members to ensure code quality and functionality before it is merged. This process ensures that all changes are vetted and approved, maintaining the integrity of the project.
